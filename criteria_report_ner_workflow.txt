Criteria that the workflow has to comprise:

1. Data Collection:
	1.1. Origin of the data 
		- rawText: Research abstracts taken from PubMed, related to breast cancer whose study type is RCT (randomized controlled trial), and are not meta-analysis or systematicreviews. This was achieved by using keywords such as “breast cancer,” “randomized controlled,”
“randomised controlled,” “meta-analysis,” and “systematic review.”
		- annotation_type: manual
	1.2. Sample size:
		- the corpus consists of 1011 annotated abstracts and 17739 entities and 26 entity categories
2. Data preprocessing
	2.1. Cleaning process
	2.2. Annotation preparation (number of experts, instructions for entity recognition,
quality analysis)*
		- number of experts: 2
		- instructions: section 3.2 Annotation process in original PICO dataset article ( https://aclanthology.org/2022.wiesp-1.4.pdf )

	2.3. Transformation tool for compatibility with models input format (entity format,
dealing with overlapping entities,etc.)
		- format: IOB
		- tool brat anntoconll.py script
		- extra modifications: changes on how to deal with overlaps
3. Experimental setup
	3.1. How samples were allocated for training/validation/testing
		- splits: train 80%, valid 40% test 40%
		- availability site: huggingface | local files | zenodo
	3.2. Definition of the specific metrics or statistics used to report results
		f1-score and accuracy - mean, standard deviation
		p-value
		frequency of entities, number of files that they appear
	3.3. Framework/scorer used for computing the metrics or statistics
		- seqeval library to compute the micro macro avg f1 score designed to ner output
		scipy for the statistical tests
	3.4. Software environment 
		- availability site: In GitHub
		- pretrained models: longformer & biobert
	3.5. Hardware environment
		NVIDIA RTX A6000 with 48GiB of GDDR6 GPU
	3.6. Clear description of the model (availability and version)
		biobert - https://huggingface.co/dmis-lab/biobert-base-cased-v1.2 - 1.2
		longformer - https://huggingface.co/allenai/longformer-base-4096 - 
4. Training process
	4.1. The range of hyperparameters considered, method to select the best hyperparameter configuration, and specification of all hyperparameters used to generate results
		the hyperarameter names are learning_rate,weight_decay, per_device_train_batch_size, per_device_eval_batch_size
		it was used the optuna framework
	4.2. Exact number of evaluation runs
		15 trials
